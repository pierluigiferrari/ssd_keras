    Build a Keras model with SSD architecture, see references.

    The model consists of convolutional feature layers and a number of convolutional
    predictor layers that take their input from different feature layers.
    The model is fully convolutional.

    The implementation found here is a smaller version of the original architecture
    used in the paper (where the base network consists of a modified VGG-16 extended
    by a few convolutional feature layers), but of course it could easily be changed to
    an arbitrarily large SSD architecture by following the general design pattern used here.
    This implementation has 7 convolutional layers and 4 convolutional predictor
    layers that take their input from layers 4, 5, 6, and 7, respectively.

    In case you're wondering why this function has so many arguments: All arguments except
    the first two (`image_size` and `n_classes`) are only needed so that the anchor box
    layers can produce the correct anchor boxes. In case you're training the network, the
    parameters passed here must be the same as the ones used to set up `SSDBoxEncoder`.
    In case you're loading trained weights, the parameters passed here must be the same
    as the ones used to produce the trained weights.

    Some of these arguments are explained in more detail in the documentation of the
    `SSDBoxEncoder` class.

    Note: Requires Keras v2.0 or later. Training currently works only with the
    TensorFlow backend (v1.0 or later).

    Arguments:
        image_size (tuple): The input image size in the format `(height, width, channels)`.
        n_classes (int): The number of categories for classification including
            the background class (i.e. the number of positive classes +1 for
            the background calss).
        min_scale (float, optional): The smallest scaling factor for the size of the anchor boxes as a fraction
            of the shorter side of the input images. Defaults to 0.1.
        max_scale (float, optional): The largest scaling factor for the size of the anchor boxes as a fraction
            of the shorter side of the input images. All scaling factors between the smallest and the
            largest will be linearly interpolated. Note that the second to last of the linearly interpolated
            scaling factors will actually be the scaling factor for the last predictor layer, while the last
            scaling factor is used for the second box for aspect ratio 1 in the last predictor layer
            if `two_boxes_for_ar1` is `True`. Defaults to 0.9.
        scales (list, optional): A list of floats containing scaling factors per convolutional predictor layer.
            This list must be one element longer than the number of predictor layers. The first `k` elements are the
            scaling factors for the `k` predictor layers, while the last element is used for the second box
            for aspect ratio 1 in the last predictor layer if `two_boxes_for_ar1` is `True`. This additional
            last scaling factor must be passed either way, even if it is not being used.
            Defaults to `None`. If a list is passed, this argument overrides `min_scale` and
            `max_scale`. All scaling factors must be greater than zero.
        aspect_ratios_global (list, optional): The list of aspect ratios for which anchor boxes are to be
            generated. This list is valid for all predictor layers. The original implementation uses more aspect ratios
            for some predictor layers and fewer for others. If you want to do that, too, then use the next argument instead.
            Defaults to `[0.5, 1.0, 2.0]`.
        aspect_ratios_per_layer (list, optional): A list containing one aspect ratio list for each predictor layer.
            This allows you to set the aspect ratios for each predictor layer individually. If a list is passed,
            it overrides `aspect_ratios_global`. Defaults to `None`.
        two_boxes_for_ar1 (bool, optional): Only relevant for aspect ratio lists that contain 1. Will be ignored otherwise.
            If `True`, two anchor boxes will be generated for aspect ratio 1. The first will be generated
            using the scaling factor for the respective layer, the second one will be generated using
            geometric mean of said scaling factor and next bigger scaling factor. Defaults to `True`, following the original
            implementation.
        limit_boxes (bool, optional): If `True`, limits box coordinates to stay within image boundaries.
            This would normally be set to `True`, but here it defaults to `False`, following the original
            implementation.
        variances (list, optional): A list of 4 floats >0 with scaling factors (actually it's not factors but divisors
            to be precise) for the encoded predicted box coordinates. A variance value of 1.0 would apply
            no scaling at all to the predictions, while values in (0,1) upscale the encoded predictions and values greater
            than 1.0 downscale the encoded predictions. If you want to reproduce the configuration of the original SSD,
            set this to `[0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.2]`, provided the coordinate format is 'centroids'. Defaults to `[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]`.
        coords (str, optional): The box coordinate format to be used. Can be either 'centroids' for the format
            `(cx, cy, w, h)` (box center coordinates, width, and height) or 'minmax' for the format
            `(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)`. Defaults to 'centroids'.
        normalize_coords (bool, optional): Set to `True` if the model is supposed to use relative instead of absolute coordinates,
            i.e. if the model predicts box coordinates within [0,1] instead of absolute coordinates. Defaults to `False`.

    Returns:
        model: The Keras SSD model.
        predictor_sizes: A Numpy array containing the `(height, width)` portion
            of the output tensor shape for each convolutional predictor layer. During
            training, the generator function needs this in order to transform
            the ground truth labels into tensors of identical structure as the
            output tensors of the model, which is in turn needed for the cost
            function.
