    '''
    Perform greedy non-maximum suppression on the input boxes.

    Greedy NMS works by selecting the box with the highest score and
    removing all boxes around it that are too close to it measured by IoU-similarity.
    Out of the boxes that are left over, once again the one with the highest
    score is selected and so on, until no boxes with too much overlap are left.

    Arguments:
        y_pred_decoded (list): A batch of decoded predictions. For a given batch size `n` this
            is a list of length `n` where each list element is a 2D Numpy array.
            For a batch item with `k` predicted boxes this 2D Numpy array has
            shape `(k, 6)`, where each row contains the coordinates of the respective
            box in the format `[class_id, score, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax]`.
            Technically, the number of columns doesn't have to be 6, it can be
            arbitrary as long as the first four elements of each row are
            `xmin`, `xmax`, `ymin`, `ymax` (in this order) and the last element
            is the score assigned to the prediction. Note that this function is
            agnostic to the scale of the score or what it represents.
        iou_threshold (float, optional): All boxes with a Jaccard similarity of
            greater than `iou_threshold` with a locally maximal box will be removed
            from the set of predictions, where 'maximal' refers to the box score.
        coords (str, optional): The coordinate format of `y_pred_decoded`.
            Can be one of the formats supported by `iou()`.
        border_pixels (str, optional): How to treat the border pixels of the bounding boxes.
            Can be 'include', 'exclude', or 'half'. If 'include', the border pixels belong
            to the boxes. If 'exclude', the border pixels do not belong to the boxes.
            If 'half', then one of each of the two horizontal and vertical borders belong
            to the boxex, but not the other.

    Returns:
        The predictions after removing non-maxima. The format is the same as the input format.

    Convert model prediction output back to a format that contains only the positive box predictions
    (i.e. the same format that `SSDInputEncoder` takes as input).

    After the decoding, two stages of prediction filtering are performed for each class individually:
    First confidence thresholding, then greedy non-maximum suppression. The filtering results for all
    classes are concatenated and the `top_k` overall highest confidence results constitute the final
    predictions for a given batch item. This procedure follows the original Caffe implementation.
    For a slightly different and more efficient alternative to decode raw model output that performs
    non-maximum suppresion globally instead of per class, see `decode_detections_fast()` below.

    Arguments:
        y_pred (array): The prediction output of the SSD model, expected to be a Numpy array
            of shape `(batch_size, #boxes, #classes + 4 + 4 + 4)`, where `#boxes` is the total number of
            boxes predicted by the model per image and the last axis contains
            `[one-hot vector for the classes, 4 predicted coordinate offsets, 4 anchor box coordinates, 4 variances]`.
        confidence_thresh (float, optional): A float in [0,1), the minimum classification confidence in a specific
            positive class in order to be considered for the non-maximum suppression stage for the respective class.
            A lower value will result in a larger part of the selection process being done by the non-maximum suppression
            stage, while a larger value will result in a larger part of the selection process happening in the confidence
            thresholding stage.
        iou_threshold (float, optional): A float in [0,1]. All boxes with a Jaccard similarity of greater than `iou_threshold`
            with a locally maximal box will be removed from the set of predictions for a given class, where 'maximal' refers
            to the box score.
        top_k (int, optional): The number of highest scoring predictions to be kept for each batch item after the
            non-maximum suppression stage.
        input_coords (str, optional): The box coordinate format that the model outputs. Can be either 'centroids'
            for the format `(cx, cy, w, h)` (box center coordinates, width, and height), 'minmax' for the format
            `(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)`, or 'corners' for the format `(xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax)`.
        normalize_coords (bool, optional): Set to `True` if the model outputs relative coordinates (i.e. coordinates in [0,1])
            and you wish to transform these relative coordinates back to absolute coordinates. If the model outputs
            relative coordinates, but you do not want to convert them back to absolute coordinates, set this to `False`.
            Do not set this to `True` if the model already outputs absolute coordinates, as that would result in incorrect
            coordinates. Requires `img_height` and `img_width` if set to `True`.
        img_height (int, optional): The height of the input images. Only needed if `normalize_coords` is `True`.
        img_width (int, optional): The width of the input images. Only needed if `normalize_coords` is `True`.
        border_pixels (str, optional): How to treat the border pixels of the bounding boxes.
            Can be 'include', 'exclude', or 'half'. If 'include', the border pixels belong
            to the boxes. If 'exclude', the border pixels do not belong to the boxes.

    Convert model prediction output back to a format that contains only the positive box predictions
    (i.e. the same format that `enconde_y()` takes as input).

    Optionally performs confidence thresholding and greedy non-maximum suppression after the decoding stage.

    Note that the decoding procedure used here is not the same as the procedure used in the original Caffe implementation.
    For each box, the procedure used here assigns the box's highest confidence as its predicted class. Then it removes
    all boxes for which the highest confidence is the background class. This results in less work for the subsequent
    non-maximum suppression, because the vast majority of the predictions will be filtered out just by the fact that
    their highest confidence is for the background class. It is much more efficient than the procedure of the original
    implementation, but the results may also differ.

    Arguments:
        y_pred (array): The prediction output of the SSD model, expected to be a Numpy array
            of shape `(batch_size, #boxes, #classes + 4 + 4 + 4)`, where `#boxes` is the total number of
            boxes predicted by the model per image and the last axis contains
            `[one-hot vector for the classes, 4 predicted coordinate offsets, 4 anchor box coordinates, 4 variances]`.
        confidence_thresh (float, optional): A float in [0,1), the minimum classification confidence in any positive
            class required for a given box to be considered a positive prediction. A lower value will result
            in better recall, while a higher value will result in better precision. Do not use this parameter with the
            goal to combat the inevitably many duplicates that an SSD will produce, the subsequent non-maximum suppression
            stage will take care of those.
        iou_threshold (float, optional): `None` or a float in [0,1]. If `None`, no non-maximum suppression will be
            performed. If not `None`, greedy NMS will be performed after the confidence thresholding stage, meaning
            all boxes with a Jaccard similarity of greater than `iou_threshold` with a locally maximal box will be removed
            from the set of predictions, where 'maximal' refers to the box score.
        top_k (int, optional): 'all' or an integer with number of highest scoring predictions to be kept for each batch item
            after the non-maximum suppression stage. If 'all', all predictions left after the NMS stage will be kept.
        input_coords (str, optional): The box coordinate format that the model outputs. Can be either 'centroids'
            for the format `(cx, cy, w, h)` (box center coordinates, width, and height), 'minmax' for the format
            `(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)`, or 'corners' for the format `(xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax)`.
        normalize_coords (bool, optional): Set to `True` if the model outputs relative coordinates (i.e. coordinates in [0,1])
            and you wish to transform these relative coordinates back to absolute coordinates. If the model outputs
            relative coordinates, but you do not want to convert them back to absolute coordinates, set this to `False`.
            Do not set this to `True` if the model already outputs absolute coordinates, as that would result in incorrect
            coordinates. Requires `img_height` and `img_width` if set to `True`.
        img_height (int, optional): The height of the input images. Only needed if `normalize_coords` is `True`.
        img_width (int, optional): The width of the input images. Only needed if `normalize_coords` is `True`.
        border_pixels (str, optional): How to treat the border pixels of the bounding boxes.
            Can be 'include', 'exclude', or 'half'. If 'include', the border pixels belong
            to the boxes. If 'exclude', the border pixels do not belong to the boxes.

    This decoder performs the same processing as `decode_detections()`, but the output format for each left-over
    predicted box is `[box_id, class_id, confidence, xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax]`.

    That is, in addition to the usual data, each predicted box has the internal index of that box within
    the model (`box_id`) prepended to it. This allows you to know exactly which part of the model made a given
    box prediction; in particular, it allows you to know which predictor layer made a given prediction.
    This can be useful for debugging.

    Arguments:
        y_pred (array): The prediction output of the SSD model, expected to be a Numpy array
            of shape `(batch_size, #boxes, #classes + 4 + 4 + 4)`, where `#boxes` is the total number of
            boxes predicted by the model per image and the last axis contains
            `[one-hot vector for the classes, 4 predicted coordinate offsets, 4 anchor box coordinates, 4 variances]`.
        confidence_thresh (float, optional): A float in [0,1), the minimum classification confidence in a specific
            positive class in order to be considered for the non-maximum suppression stage for the respective class.
            A lower value will result in a larger part of the selection process being done by the non-maximum suppression
            stage, while a larger value will result in a larger part of the selection process happening in the confidence
            thresholding stage.
        iou_threshold (float, optional): A float in [0,1]. All boxes with a Jaccard similarity of greater than `iou_threshold`
            with a locally maximal box will be removed from the set of predictions for a given class, where 'maximal' refers
            to the box score.
        top_k (int, optional): The number of highest scoring predictions to be kept for each batch item after the
            non-maximum suppression stage.
        input_coords (str, optional): The box coordinate format that the model outputs. Can be either 'centroids'
            for the format `(cx, cy, w, h)` (box center coordinates, width, and height), 'minmax' for the format
            `(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)`, or 'corners' for the format `(xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax)`.
        normalize_coords (bool, optional): Set to `True` if the model outputs relative coordinates (i.e. coordinates in [0,1])
            and you wish to transform these relative coordinates back to absolute coordinates. If the model outputs
            relative coordinates, but you do not want to convert them back to absolute coordinates, set this to `False`.
            Do not set this to `True` if the model already outputs absolute coordinates, as that would result in incorrect
            coordinates. Requires `img_height` and `img_width` if set to `True`.
        img_height (int, optional): The height of the input images. Only needed if `normalize_coords` is `True`.
        img_width (int, optional): The width of the input images. Only needed if `normalize_coords` is `True`.
        border_pixels (str, optional): How to treat the border pixels of the bounding boxes.
            Can be 'include', 'exclude', or 'half'. If 'include', the border pixels belong
            to the boxes. If 'exclude', the border pixels do not belong to the boxes.
            If 'half', then one of each of the two horizontal and vertical borders belong
            to the boxex, but not the other.

    Returns:
        A python list of length `batch_size` where each list element represents the predicted boxes
        for one image and contains a Numpy array of shape `(boxes, 7)` where each row is a box prediction for
        a non-background class for the respective image in the format `[box_id, class_id, confidence, xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax]`.
