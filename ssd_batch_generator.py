        independent application probability. The transformations are performed
        in the order of their arguments, i.e. equalization is performed first,
        grayscale conversion is performed last.

        `prob` works the same way in all arguments in which it appears. It must be a float in [0,1]
        and determines the probability that the respective transform is applied to a given image.

        All conversions and transforms default to `False`.

        Arguments:
            batch_size (int, optional): The size of the batches to be generated. Defaults to 32.
            train (bool, optional): Whether or not the generator is used in training mode. If `True`, then the labels
                will be transformed into the format that the SSD cost function requires. Otherwise,
                the output format of the labels is identical to the input format. Defaults to `True`.
            ssd_box_encoder (SSDBoxEncoder, optional): Only required if `train = True`. An SSDBoxEncoder object
                to encode the ground truth labels to the required format for training an SSD model.
            equalize (bool, optional): If `True`, performs histogram equalization on the images.
                This can improve contrast and lead the improved model performance.
            brightness (tuple, optional): `False` or a tuple containing three floats, `(min, max, prob)`.
                Scales the brightness of the image by a factor randomly picked from a uniform
                distribution in the boundaries of `[min, max]`. Both min and max must be >=0.
            flip (float, optional): `False` or a float in [0,1], see `prob` above. Flip the image horizontally.
                The respective box coordinates are adjusted accordingly.
            translate (tuple, optional): `False` or a tuple, with the first two elements tuples containing
                two integers each, and the third element a float: `((min, max), (min, max), prob)`.
                The first tuple provides the range in pixels for horizontal shift of the image,
                the second tuple for vertical shift. The number of pixels to shift the image
                by is uniformly distributed within the boundaries of `[min, max]`, i.e. `min` is the number
                of pixels by which the image is translated at least. Both `min` and `max` must be >=0.
                The respective box coordinates are adjusted accordingly.
            scale (tuple, optional): `False` or a tuple containing three floats, `(min, max, prob)`.
                Scales the image by a factor randomly picked from a uniform distribution in the boundaries
                of `[min, max]`. Both min and max must be >=0.
            random_crop (tuple, optional): `False` or a tuple of four integers, `(height, width, min_1_object, max_#_trials)`,
                where `height` and `width` are the height and width of the patch that is to be cropped out at a random
                position in the input image. Note that `height` and `width` can be arbitrary - they are allowed to be larger
                than the image height and width, in which case the original image will be randomly placed on a black background
                canvas of size `(height, width)`. `min_1_object` is either 0 or 1. If 1, there must be at least one detectable
                object remaining in the image for the crop to be valid, and if 0, crops with no detectable objects left in the
                image patch are allowed. `max_#_trials` is only relevant if `min_1_object == 1` and sets the maximum number
                of attempts to get a valid crop. If no valid crop was obtained within this maximum number of attempts,
                the respective image will be removed from the batch without replacement (i.e. for each removed image, the batch
                will be one sample smaller). Defaults to `False`.
            crop (tuple, optional): `False` or a tuple of four integers, `(crop_top, crop_bottom, crop_left, crop_right)`,
                with the number of pixels to crop off of each side of the images.
                The targets are adjusted accordingly. Note: Cropping happens before resizing.
            resize (tuple, optional): `False` or a tuple of 2 integers for the desired output
                size of the images in pixels. The expected format is `(width, height)`.
                The box coordinates are adjusted accordingly. Note: Resizing happens after cropping.
            gray (bool, optional): If `True`, converts the images to grayscale.
            limit_boxes (bool, optional): If `True`, limits box coordinates to stay within image boundaries
                post any transformation. This should always be set to `True`, even if you set `include_thresh`
                to 0. I don't even know why I made this an option. If this is set to `False`, you could
                end up with some boxes that lie entirely outside the image boundaries after a given transformation
                and such boxes would of course not make any sense and have a strongly adverse effect on the learning.
            include_thresh (float, optional): Only relevant if `limit_boxes` is `True`. Determines the minimum
                fraction of the area of a ground truth box that must be left after limiting in order for the box
                to still be included in the batch data. If set to 0, all boxes are kept except those which lie
                entirely outside of the image bounderies after limiting. If set to 1, only boxes that did not
                need to be limited at all are kept. Defaults to 0.3.
            diagnostics (bool, optional): If `True`, yields three additional output items:
                1) A list of the image file names in the batch.
                2) An array with the original, unaltered images.
                3) A list with the original, unaltered labels.
                This can be useful for diagnostic purposes. Defaults to `False`. Only works if `train = True`.

        Yields:
            The next batch as a tuple containing a Numpy array that contains the images and a Python list
            that contains the corresponding labels for each image as 2D Numpy arrays. The output format
            of the labels is according to the `box_output_format` that was specified in the constructor.

        Perform offline image processing.

        This function has mostly the same image processing capabilities as the generator function above,
        but it performs the processing on all items in `filenames` starting at index `start`
        until index `stop` and saves the processed images to disk. The labels are adjusted
        accordingly.

        Processing images offline is useful to reduce the amount of work done by the batch
        generator and thus can speed up training. For example, transformations that are performed
        on all images in a deterministic way, such as resizing or cropping, should be done offline.

        Arguments:
            dest_path (str, optional): The destination directory where the processed images
                and `labels.csv` should be saved, ending on a slash.
            start (int, optional): The inclusive start index from which onward to process the
                items in `filenames`. Defaults to 0.
            stop (int, optional): The exclusive stop index until which to process the
                items in `filenames`. Defaults to 'all', meaning to process all items until the
                end of the list.

        For a description of the other arguments, please refer to the documentation of `generate_batch()` above.

        Returns:
            `None`, but saves all processed images as JPEG files to the specified destination
            directory and generates a `labels.csv` CSV file that is saved to the same directory.
            The format of the lines in the destination CSV file is the same as that of the
            source CSV file, i.e. `[frame, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, class_id]`.
