    in a format that is not supported by these parsers, you could just add another parser

        '''
        This class provides parser methods that you call separately after calling the constructor to assemble
        the list of image filenames and the list of labels for the dataset from CSV or XML files. If you already
        have the image filenames and labels in asuitable format (see argument descriptions below), you can pass
        them right here in the constructor, in which case you do not need to call any of the parser methods afterwards.

        In case you would like not to load any labels at all, simply pass a list of image filenames here.

        Arguments:
            box_output_format (list, optional): A list of five strings representing the desired order of the five
                items class ID, xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax in the generated data. The expected strings are
                'xmin', 'ymin', 'xmax', 'ymax', 'class_id'. If you want to train the model, this
                must be the order that the box encoding class requires as input. Defaults to
                `['class_id', 'xmin', 'ymin', 'xmax', 'ymax']`. Note that even though the parser methods are
                able to produce different output formats, the SSDBoxEncoder currently requires the format
                `['class_id', 'xmin', 'ymin', 'xmax', 'ymax']`. This list only specifies the five box parameters
                that are relevant as training targets, a list of filenames is generated separately.
            filenames (string or list, optional): `None` or either a Python list/tuple or a string representing
                a filepath. If a list/tuple is passed, it must contain the file names (full paths) of the
                images to be used. Note that the list/tuple must contain the paths to the images,
                not the images themselves. If a filepath string is passed, it must point either to
                (1) a pickled file containing a list/tuple as described above. In this case the `filenames_type`
                argument must be set to `pickle`.
                Or
                (2) a text file. Each line of the text file contains the file name (basename of the file only,
                not the full directory path) to one image and nothing else. In this case the `filenames_type`
                argument must be set to `text` and you must pass the path to the directory that contains the
                images in `images_dir`.
            filenames_type (string, optional): In case a string is passed for `filenames`, this indicates what
                type of file `filenames` is. It can be either 'pickle' for a pickled file or 'text' for a
                plain text file. Defaults to 'text'.
            images_dir (string, optional): In case a text file is passed for `filenames`, the full paths to
                the images will be composed from `images_dir` and the names in the text file, i.e. this
                should be the directory that contains the images to which the text file refers.
                If `filenames_type` is not 'text', then this argument is irrelevant. Defaults to `None`.
            labels (string or list, optional): `None` or either a Python list/tuple or a string representing
                the path to a pickled file containing a list/tuple. The list/tuple must contain Numpy arrays
                that represent the labels of the dataset.
            image_ids (string or list, optional): `None` or either a Python list/tuple or a string representing
                the path to a pickled file containing a list/tuple. The list/tuple must contain the image
                IDs of the images in the dataset.

                and each line contains the following six items: image file name, class ID, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax.
                The six items do not have to be in a specific order, but they must be the first six columns of
                each line. The order of these items in the CSV file must be specified in `input_format`.
                The class ID is an integer greater than zero. Class ID 0 is reserved for the background class.
                `xmin` and `xmax` are the left-most and right-most absolute horizontal coordinates of the box,
                `ymin` and `ymax` are the top-most and bottom-most absolute vertical coordinates of the box.
                The image name is expected to be just the name of the image file without the directory path

                in the dataset.
            random_sample (float, optional): Either `False` or a float in `[0,1]`. If this is `False`, the
                full dataset will be used by the generator. If this is a float in `[0,1]`, a randomly sampled
                fraction of the dataset will be used, where `random_sample` is the fraction of the dataset
                to be used. For example, if `random_sample = 0.2`, 20 precent of the dataset will be randomly selected,
                the rest will be ommitted. The fraction refers to the number of images, not to the number
                of boxes, i.e. each image that will be added to the dataset will always be added with all
                of its boxes. Defaults to `False`.

            image_set_filenames (list): A list of strings, where each string is the path of the text file with the image
                set to be loaded. Must be one file per image directory given. These text files define what images in the
                respective image directories are to be part of the dataset and simply contains one image ID per line
                and nothing else.
            annotations_dirs (list, optional): A list of strings, where each string is the path of a directory that
                contains the annotations (XML files) that belong to the images in the respective image directories given.
                The directories must contain one XML file per image and the name of an XML file must be the image ID
                of the image it belongs to. The content of the XML files must be in the Pascal VOC format.
            classes (list, optional): A list containing the names of the object classes as found in the
                `name` XML tags. Must include the class `background` as the first list item. The order of this list
                defines the class IDs. Defaults to the list of Pascal VOC classes in alphabetical order.
            include_classes (list, optional): Either 'all' or a list of integers containing the class IDs that
                are to be included in the dataset. Defaults to 'all', in which case all boxes will be included
                in the dataset.
            exclude_truncated (bool, optional): If `True`, excludes boxes that are labeled as 'truncated'.
            exclude_difficult (bool, optional): If `True`, excludes boxes that are labeled as 'difficult'.

        Returns:
            None by default, optionally the image filenames and labels.

        Generate batches of samples and corresponding labels indefinitely from
        lists of filenames and labels.

        Returns two Numpy arrays, one containing the next `batch_size` samples
        from `filenames`, the other containing the corresponding labels from
        `labels`.

        Can shuffle `filenames` and `labels` consistently after each complete pass.

        Can perform image transformations for data conversion and data augmentation.
        Each data augmentation process can set its own independent application probability.
        The transformations are performed in the order of their arguments, i.e. translation
        is performed before scaling. All conversions and transforms default to `False`.

        `prob` works the same way in all arguments in which it appears. It must be a float in [0,1]
        and determines the probability that the respective transform is applied to a given image.

        Arguments:
            batch_size (int, optional): The size of the batches to be generated.
            shuffle (bool, optional): Whether or not to shuffle the dataset before each pass.
                This option should always be `True` during training, but it can be useful to turn shuffling off
                for debugging or if you're using the generator for prediction.
            train (bool, optional): Whether or not the generator is used in training mode. If `True`, then the labels
                will be transformed into the format that the SSD cost function requires. Otherwise,
                the output format of the labels is identical to the input format.
            ssd_box_encoder (SSDBoxEncoder, optional): Only required if `train = True`. An SSDBoxEncoder object
                to encode the ground truth labels to the required format for training an SSD model.
            returns (set, optional): A set of strings that determines what outputs the generator yields. The generator's output
                is always a tuple with the processed images as its first element and, if in training mode, the encoded
                labels as its second element. Apart from that, the output tuple can contain additional outputs according
                to the keywords in `returns`. The possible keyword strings and their respective outputs are:
                * 'processed_images': An array containing the processed images. Will always be in the outputs, so it doesn't
                    matter whether or not you include this keyword in the set.
                * 'encoded_labels': The encoded labels tensor. This is an array of shape `(batch_size, n_boxes, n_classes + 12)`
                    that is the output of `SSDBoxEncoder.encode_y()`. Will always be in the outputs if in training mode,
                    so it doesn't matter whether or not you include this keyword in the set if in training mode.
                * 'matched_anchors': The same as 'encoded_labels', but containing anchor box coordinates for all matched
                    anchor boxes instead of ground truth coordinates. The can be useful to visualize what anchor boxes
                    are being matched to each ground truth box. Only available in training mode.
                * 'processed_labels': The processed, but not yet encoded labels. This is a list that contains for each
                    batch image a Numpy array with all ground truth boxes for that image. Only available if ground truth is available.
                * 'filenames': A list containing the file names (full paths) of the images in the batch.
                * 'image_ids': A list containing the integer IDs of the images in the batch. Only available if there
                    are image IDs available.
                * 'inverse_transform': An array of shape `(batch_size, 4, 2)` that contains two coordinate conversion values for
                    each image in the batch and for each of the four coordinates. These these coordinate conversion values makes
                    it possible to convert the box coordinates that were predicted on a transformed image back to what those coordinates
                    would be in the original image. This is mostly relevant for evaluation: If you want to evaluate your model on
                    a dataset with varying image sizes, then you are forced to transform the images somehow (by resizing or cropping)
                    to make them all the same size. Your model will then predict boxes for those transformed images, but for the
                    evaluation you will need the box coordinates to be correct for the original images, not for the transformed
                    images. This means you will have to transform the predicted box coordinates back to the original image sizes.
                    Since the images have varying sizes, the function that transforms the coordinates is different for every image.
                    This array contains the necessary conversion values for every coordinate of every image in the batch.
                    In order to convert coordinates to the original image sizes, first multiply each coordinate by the second
                    conversion value, then add the first conversion value to it. Note that the conversion will only be correct
                    for the `resize`, `random_crop`, `max_crop_and_resize` and `random_pad_and_resize` transformations.
                * 'original_images': A list containing the original images in the batch before any processing.
                * 'original_labels': A list containing the original ground truth boxes for the images in this batch before any
                    processing. Only available if ground truth is available.
                The order of the outputs in the tuple is the order of the list above. If `returns` contains a keyword for an
                output that is unavailable, that output will simply be skipped and not be part of the yielded tuple.
            equalize (bool, optional): If `True`, performs histogram equalization on the images.
                This can improve contrast and lead the improved model performance.
            brightness (tuple, optional): `False` or a tuple containing three floats, `(min, max, prob)`.
                Scales the brightness of the image by a factor randomly picked from a uniform
                distribution in the boundaries of `[min, max]`. Both min and max must be >=0.
            flip (float, optional): `False` or a float in [0,1], see `prob` above. Flip the image horizontally.
                The respective box coordinates are adjusted accordingly.
            translate (tuple, optional): `False` or a tuple, with the first two elements tuples containing
                two integers each, and the third element a float: `((min, max), (min, max), prob)`.
                The first tuple provides the range in pixels for the horizontal shift of the image,
                the second tuple for the vertical shift. The number of pixels to shift the image
                by is uniformly distributed within the boundaries of `[min, max]`, i.e. `min` is the number
                of pixels by which the image is translated at least. Both `min` and `max` must be >=0.
                The respective box coordinates are adjusted accordingly.
            scale (tuple, optional): `False` or a tuple containing three floats, `(min, max, prob)`.
                Scales the image by a factor randomly picked from a uniform distribution in the boundaries
                of `[min, max]`. Both min and max must be >=0.
            max_crop_and_resize (tuple, optional): `False` or a tuple of four integers, `(height, width, min_1_object, max_#_trials)`.
                This will crop out the maximal possible image patch with an aspect ratio defined by `height` and `width` from the
                input image and then resize the resulting patch to `(height, width)`. This preserves the aspect ratio of the original
                image, but does not contain the entire original image (unless the aspect ratio of the original image is the same as
                the target aspect ratio) The latter two components of the tuple work identically as in `random_crop`.
                Note the difference to `random_crop`: This operation crops patches of variable size and fixed aspect ratio from the
                input image and then resizes the patch, while `random_crop` crops patches of fixed size and fixed aspect ratio from
                the input image. If this operation is active, it overrides both `random_crop` and `resize`.
            random_pad_and_resize (tuple, optional): `False` or a tuple of four integers and one float,
                `(height, width, min_1_object, max_#_trials, mix_ratio)`. The input image will first be padded with zeros such that
                it has the aspect ratio defined by `height` and `width` and afterwards resized to `(height, width)`. This preserves
                the aspect ratio of the original image an scales it to the maximum possible size that still fits inside a canvas of
                size `(height, width)`. The third and fourth components of the tuple work identically as in `random_crop`.
                `mix_ratio` is only relevant if `max_crop_and_resize` is active, in which case it must be a float in `[0, 1]` that
                decides what ratio of images will be processed using `max_crop_and_resize` and what ratio of images will be processed
                using `random_pad_and_resize`. If `mix_ratio` is 1, all images will be processed using `random_pad_and_resize`.
                Note the difference to `max_crop_and_resize`: While `max_crop_and_resize` will crop out the largest possible patch
                that still lies fully within the input image, the patch generated here will always contain the full input image.
                If this operation is active, it overrides both `random_crop` and `resize`.
            random_crop (tuple, optional): `False` or a tuple of four integers, `(height, width, min_1_object, max_#_trials)`,
                where `height` and `width` are the height and width of the patch that is to be cropped out at a random
                position in the input image. Note that `height` and `width` can be arbitrary - they are allowed to be larger
                than the image height and width, in which case the original image will be randomly placed on a black background
                canvas of size `(height, width)`. `min_1_object` is either 0 or 1. If 1, there must be at least one detectable
                object remaining in the image for the crop to be valid, and if 0, crops with no detectable objects left in the
                image patch are allowed. `max_#_trials` is only relevant if `min_1_object == 1` and sets the maximum number
                of attempts to get a valid crop. If no valid crop was obtained within this maximum number of attempts,
                the respective image will be removed from the batch without replacement (i.e. for each removed image, the batch
                will be one sample smaller).
            crop (tuple, optional): `False` or a tuple of four integers, `(crop_top, crop_bottom, crop_left, crop_right)`,
                with the number of pixels to crop off of each side of the images.
                The targets are adjusted accordingly. Note: Cropping happens before resizing.
            resize (tuple, optional): `False` or a tuple of 2 integers for the desired output
                size of the images in pixels. The expected format is `(height, width)`.
                The box coordinates are adjusted accordingly. Note: Resizing happens after cropping.
            gray (bool, optional): If `True`, converts the images to grayscale. Note that the resulting grayscale
                images have shape `(height, width, 1)`.
            limit_boxes (bool, optional): If `True`, limits box coordinates to stay within image boundaries
                post any transformation. This should always be set to `True`, even if you set `include_thresh`
                to 0. I don't even know why I made this an option. If this is set to `False`, you could
                end up with some boxes that lie entirely outside the image boundaries after a given transformation
                and such boxes would of course not make any sense and have a strongly adverse effect on the learning.
            include_thresh (float, optional): Only relevant if `limit_boxes` is `True`. Determines the minimum
                fraction of the area of a ground truth box that must be left after limiting in order for the box
                to still be included in the batch data. If set to 0, all boxes are kept except those which lie
                entirely outside of the image bounderies after limiting. If set to 1, only boxes that did not
                need to be limited at all are kept.
            subtract_mean (array-like, optional): `None` or an array-like object of integers or floating point values
                of any shape that is broadcast-compatible with the image shape. The elements of this array will be
                subtracted from the image pixel intensity values. For example, pass a list of three integers
                to perform per-channel mean normalization for color images.
            divide_by_stddev (array-like, optional): `None` or an array-like object of non-zero integers or
                floating point values of any shape that is broadcast-compatible with the image shape. The image pixel
                intensity values will be divided by the elements of this array. For example, pass a list
                of three integers to perform per-channel standard deviation normalization for color images.
            swap_channels (bool, optional): If `True` the color channel order of the input images will be reversed,
                i.e. if the input color channel order is RGB, the color channels will be swapped to BGR.
            keep_images_without_gt (bool, optional): If `True`, images for which there are no ground truth boxes
                (either because there weren't any to begin with or because random cropping cropped out a patch that
                doesn't contain any objects) will be kept in the batch. If `False`, such images will be removed
                from the batch.
            convert_to_3_channels (bool, optional): If `True`, single-channel images will be converted
                to 3-channel images.

        Yields:
            The next batch as a tuple of items as defined by the `returns` argument. By default, this will be
            a 2-tuple containing the processed batch images as its first element and the encoded ground truth boxes
            tensor as its second element if in training mode, or a 1-tuple containing only the processed batch images if
            not in training mode. Any additional outputs must be specified in the `returns` argument.

        Perform offline image processing.

        This function has mostly the same image processing capabilities as the generator function above,
        but it performs the processing on all items in `filenames` starting at index `start`
        until index `stop` and saves the processed images to disk. The labels are adjusted
        accordingly.

        Processing images offline is useful to reduce the amount of work done by the batch
        generator and thus can speed up training. For example, transformations that are performed
        on all images in a deterministic way, such as resizing or cropping, should be done offline.

        Arguments:
            dest_path (str, optional): The destination directory where the processed images
                and `labels.csv` should be saved, ending on a slash.
            start (int, optional): The inclusive start index from which onward to process the
                items in `filenames`. Defaults to 0.
            stop (int, optional): The exclusive stop index until which to process the
                items in `filenames`. Defaults to 'all', meaning to process all items until the
                end of the list.

        For a description of the other arguments, please refer to the documentation of `generate_batch()` above.

        Returns:
            `None`, but saves all processed images as JPEG files to the specified destination
            directory and generates a `labels.csv` CSV file that is saved to the same directory.
            The format of the lines in the destination CSV file is the same as that of the
            source CSV file, i.e. `[frame, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, class_id]`.
