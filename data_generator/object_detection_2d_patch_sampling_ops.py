            img_height (int): The height of the image for which the patch coordinates
                shall be generated. Doesn't have to be known upon construction.
            img_width (int): The width of the image for which the patch coordinates
                shall be generated. Doesn't have to be known upon construction.
            must_match (str, optional): Can be either of 'h_w', 'h_ar', and 'w_ar'.
                Specifies which two of the three quantities height, width, and aspect
                ratio determine the shape of the generated patch. The respective third
                quantity will be computed from the other two. For example,
                if `must_match == 'h_w'`, then the patch's height and width will be
                set to lie within [min_scale, max_scale] of the image size or to
                `patch_height` and/or `patch_width`, if given. The patch's aspect ratio
                is the dependent variable in this case, it will be computed from the
                height and width. Any given values for `patch_aspect_ratio`,
                `min_aspect_ratio`, or `max_aspect_ratio` will be ignored.
            min_scale (float, optional): The minimum size of a dimension of the patch
                as a fraction of the respective dimension of the image. Can be greater
                than 1. For example, if the image width is 200 and `min_scale == 0.5`,
                then the width of the generated patch will be at least 100. If `min_scale == 1.5`,
                the width of the generated patch will be at least 300.
            max_scale (float, optional): The maximum size of a dimension of the patch
                as a fraction of the respective dimension of the image. Can be greater
                than 1. For example, if the image width is 200 and `max_scale == 1.0`,
                then the width of the generated patch will be at most 200. If `max_scale == 1.5`,
                the width of the generated patch will be at most 300. Must be greater than
                `min_scale`.
            scale_uniformly (bool, optional): If `True` and if `must_match == 'h_w'`,
                the patch height and width will be scaled uniformly, otherwise they will
                be scaled independently.
            min_aspect_ratio (float, optional): Determines the minimum aspect ratio
                for the generated patches.
            max_aspect_ratio (float, optional): Determines the maximum aspect ratio
                for the generated patches.
            patch_ymin (int, optional): `None` or the vertical coordinate of the top left
                corner of the generated patches. If this is not `None`, the position of the
                patches along the vertical axis is fixed. If this is `None`, then the
                vertical position of generated patches will be chosen randomly such that
                the overlap of a patch and the image along the vertical dimension is
                always maximal.
            patch_xmin (int, optional): `None` or the horizontal coordinate of the top left
                corner of the generated patches. If this is not `None`, the position of the
                patches along the horizontal axis is fixed. If this is `None`, then the
                horizontal position of generated patches will be chosen randomly such that

    As opposed to `RandomPatchInf`, it is possible for this transform to fail to produce
    an output image at all, in which case it will return `None`. This is useful, because
    if this transform is used to generate patches of a fixed size or aspect ratio, then
    the caller needs to be able to rely on the output image satisfying the set size or
    aspect ratio. It might therefore not be an option to return the unaltered input image
    as other random transforms do when they fail to produce a valid transformed image.
