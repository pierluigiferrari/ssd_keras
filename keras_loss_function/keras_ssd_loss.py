    def __init__(self,
                 neg_pos_ratio=3,
                 n_neg_min=0,
                 alpha=1.0):
        '''
        Arguments:
            neg_pos_ratio (int, optional): The maximum ratio of negative (i.e. background)
                to positive ground truth boxes to include in the loss computation.
                There are no actual background ground truth boxes of course, but `y_true`
                contains anchor boxes labeled with the background class. Since
                the number of background boxes in `y_true` will usually exceed
                the number of positive boxes by far, it is necessary to balance
                their influence on the loss. Defaults to 3 following the paper.
            n_neg_min (int, optional): The minimum number of negative ground truth boxes to
                enter the loss computation *per batch*. This argument can be used to make
                sure that the model learns from a minimum number of negatives in batches
                in which there are very few, or even none at all, positive ground truth
                boxes. It defaults to 0 and if used, it should be set to a value that
                stands in reasonable proportion to the batch size used for training.
            alpha (float, optional): A factor to weight the localization loss in the
                computation of the total loss. Defaults to 1.0 following the paper.

        Compute smooth L1 loss, see references.

        Arguments:
            y_true (nD tensor): A TensorFlow tensor of any shape containing the ground truth data.
                In this context, the expected tensor has shape `(batch_size, #boxes, 4)` and
                contains the ground truth bounding box coordinates, where the last dimension
                contains `(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)`.
            y_pred (nD tensor): A TensorFlow tensor of identical structure to `y_true` containing
                the predicted data, in this context the predicted bounding box coordinates.

        Returns:
            The smooth L1 loss, a nD-1 Tensorflow tensor. In this context a 2D tensor
            of shape (batch, n_boxes_total).

    def compute_loss(self, y_true, y_pred):
        '''
        Compute the loss of the SSD model prediction against the ground truth.

        Arguments:
            y_true (array): A Numpy array of shape `(batch_size, #boxes, #classes + 12)`,
                where `#boxes` is the total number of boxes that the model predicts
                per image. Be careful to make sure that the index of each given
                box in `y_true` is the same as the index for the corresponding
                box in `y_pred`. The last axis must have length `#classes + 12` and contain
                `[classes one-hot encoded, 4 ground truth box coordinate offsets, 8 arbitrary entries]`
                in this order, including the background class. The last eight entries of the
                last axis are not used by this function and therefore their contents are
                irrelevant, they only exist so that `y_true` has the same shape as `y_pred`,
                where the last four entries of the last axis contain the anchor box
                coordinates, which are needed during inference. Important: Boxes that
                you want the cost function to ignore need to have a one-hot
                class vector of all zeros.
            y_pred (Keras tensor): The model prediction. The shape is identical
                to that of `y_true`, i.e. `(batch_size, #boxes, #classes + 12)`.
                The last axis must contain entries in the format
                `[classes one-hot encoded, 4 predicted box coordinate offsets, 8 arbitrary entries]`.

        Returns:
            A scalar, the total multitask loss for classification and localization.
